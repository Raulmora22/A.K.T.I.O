Backgrounds Textures
--------------------
There is an increasing trend towards using non-plastic materials to make 
custom keyboards.  We provide selection of background textures to aid in
designing & visualizing such keyboards.

The textures were sourced from various sites around the web and are believed 
to all be free to use.  In some cases, the source images were scaled, rotated, 
or cropped.  If you feel your copyright is being infringed, please advise and 
the offending material will be removed.

Sources:

* Many of the materials were sourced from [bgfons.com](http://bgfons.com):
  * [Aluminium](http://bgfons.com/img/materials/aluminum)
  * [Carbon fibres](http://bgfons.com/img/materials/carbon)
  * [Titanium](http://bgfons.com/img/materials/titanium)
  * [Iron/Steel](http://bgfons.com/img/materials/iron)
  * [Marble](http://bgfons.com/img/materials/marble)
  * [Leather](http://bgfons.com/img/materials/leather)
* The 'Plastic' backgrounds were created by selecting a small, defect-free 
  region of photographs of [Signature Plastics](http://www.keycapsdirect.com/) 
  colour swatches and then making them into seamless tiles in Gimp.
  * Note that Signature Plastics does not manufacture actual keyboard cases.
* Two of the 'Leather' textures ('Black' and 'Brown') are from
  [Free PSD Files](http://freepsdfiles.net/backgrounds/4-free-leather-textures).
* 'Red Mahogany' is by DeviantArt user [SweetSoulSister](http://sweetsoulsister.deviantart.com/art/Red-Mahogany-Wood-Texture-146083467)
* Most of the 'Wood' textures and some of the metallic textures are from
